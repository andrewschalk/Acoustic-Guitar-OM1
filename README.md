# Acoustic Guitar Orchestra Model Version 1
<img src="/images/GuitarRender.png" alt="3D Render of Guitar" style="height: 200px;"/>

This is a custom designed acoustic guitar. It's an Orchestra style guitar, meaning that it's a medium size guitar designed for both fingerpicking and strumming. The design is largely based off of the guitar in Jonathan Kinkead's book: "Build Your Own Acoustic Guitar" which I highly recommend. Because this was the first guitar I built, the design I came up with is mostly based on what was easiest for me.
## CAD

### Jigs
The Jigs folder contains drawings and models of the jigs I built to help build the guitar. For more information on the jigs, see the imgur post below.
